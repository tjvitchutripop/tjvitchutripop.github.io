<p>The Charlottesville Debate League (CDL) is a non-profit organization dedicated to expanding free and accessible speech and debate programs across Central Virginia. Founded in 2013 by a small but persistent group of University of Virginia students, CDL has since grown to number nearly a hundred student members and has over 200 middle and high school students in our programs.</p>
<p>As a current <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">teacher</code> and former <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Head Teacher</code> of CDL...</p> 
<li>I've mentored 30+ middle school students on extemporaneous speaking and public forum debate.</li>
<li>I discuss with other CDL teachers on the best ways to implement curriculum and maintain high student engagement.</li>
<li>I've analyzed effective teaching strategies from Charlottesville Debate League teachers at 10+ schools.</li>
<li>I've developed <a href="https://github.com/tjvitchutripop/sorting-hat">Sorting Hat</a>, a React and Node.js web-application that assists in forming teaching teams.</li>
