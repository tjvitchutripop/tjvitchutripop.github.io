HooHacks is Virginia's biggest hackathon and one of the 50 biggest collegiate hackathons in the US. Additionally, HooHacks also plans Ideathon, a tech entrepeneurship networking event. Our goal is to make learning and applying software development in UVA and other colleges more accessible and fun!
<br/><br/>
As `Marketing Chair` of HooHacks...
<li>I collaborate with HooHacks executive board and lead committee members on planning marketing campaign and strategy for HooHacks, UVAâ€™s premier student-run hackathon with 1000+ participants.</li>
<li>I've established stronger relationships with organizations for underrepresented groups in STEM and regional minority-serving institutions (e.g., HBCUs) to improve diversity at our events.</li>
<li>I've hosted workshops on idea/project pitching and web application development with React + Node.js. 
<li>I've created and deployed a <a href='https://github.com/tjvitchutripop/email-app'>React and Node.js web application</a> that would allow members to easily send emails advertising events by launching the default email client with a customized email.</li>

<h3><a href='https://www.cvilledebate.com/'>Charlottesville Debate League</a></h3>
<h6>Sept. 2020 - Present</h6>
<p>The Charlottesville Debate League (CDL) is a non-profit organization dedicated to expanding free and accessible speech and debate programs across Central Virginia. Founded in 2013 by a small but persistent group of University of Virginia students, CDL has since grown to number nearly a hundred student members and has over 200 middle and high school students in our programs.</p>
<p>As a current teacher and former <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Head Teacher</code> of CDL...</p> 
<li>I've mentored 30+ middle school students on extemporaneous speaking and public forum debate.</li>
<li>I discuss with other CDL teachers on the best ways to implement curriculum and maintain high student engagement.</li>
<li>I analyzed effective teaching strategies from Charlottesville Debate League teachers at 10+ schools.</li>
