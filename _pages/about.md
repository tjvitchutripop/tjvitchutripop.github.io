Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student in <a href='https://cpsc.yale.edu'>Computer Science<a> at Yale University performing research in the <a href='https://apollo-lab-yale.github.io'>Applied Planning, Learning, and Optimization (Apollo) Lab</a>, where I am advised by <a href='https://dannyrakita.net'>Daniel Rakita<a>.

My research revolves around developing machine learning algorithms for robot perception and control grounded within the context of `mobile manipulation`, `active vision`, and `continual learning`. 

Previously, I have worked in the <a href='https://www.collabrobotics.com/'>Collaborative Robotics Lab</a> at the <a href='https://virginia.edu'>University of Virginia</a> led by Professor <a href='http://www.tiqbal.com/'>Tariq Iqbal</a>, developing `reinforcement learning` algorithms for dynamic object manipulation. Additionally, I performed `computer vision` research centered around `unsupervised instance segmentation` for robotic manipulation at the <a href='https://www.ri.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute</a> with the <a href='https://r-pad.github.io/'>Robots Perceiving and Doing (R-PAD) Lab</a> led by Professor <a href='https://davheld.github.io/'>David Held</a>.

Aside from my research, I have explored the intersection of policy and science & technology through the <a href='https://engineering.virginia.edu/future-undergrads/academics/policy-internship-program'>UVA-MIT Policy Internship Program</a>, where I interned at the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/tip/latest">National Science Foundation TIP directorate</a> working on open-sourcing and analyzing data from the first iteration of the <a href='https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/regional-innovation-engines'>NSF Engines</a> program. I also have industry experience in software engineering and test-driven development through an internship with <a href='https://finsemble.com/'>interop.io</a>.
