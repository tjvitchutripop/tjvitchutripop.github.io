Hello! I'm a rising fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Virginia studying <a href='https://www.cs.virginia.edu/'>computer science<a> + <a href='https://www.philosophy.virginia.edu/'>philosophy</a>.

My research interests are primarily in the development and application of machine learning techniques, specifically `reinforcement learning` and `representation learning`, for robotic control. Currently, I work in the <a href='https://www.collabrobotics.com/'>Collaborative Robotics Lab</a> at UVA led by Professor <a href='http://www.tiqbal.com/'>Tariq Iqbal</a>, focusing on reinforcement learning for `human-robot collaboration`. This summer, I will be performing research centered around `vision-based learning` and `object manipulation` at the <a href='https://www.ri.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute</a> with the <a href='https://r-pad.github.io/'>Robots Perceiving and Doing (R-PAD) Lab</a> led by Professor <a href='https://davheld.github.io/'>David Held</a>.

Aside from my research, I have explored the intersection of policy and science & technology through the <a href='https://engineering.virginia.edu/future-undergrads/academics/policy-internship-program'>UVA-MIT Policy Internship Program</a>, where I interned at the National Science Foundationâ€™s TIP directorate, working on open-sourcing and analyzing data from the first iteration of the <a href='https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/regional-innovation-engines'>NSF Engines</a> program. I also have industry experience in software engineering and test-driven development through an internship with <a href='https://finsemble.com/'>Finsemble</a>.
