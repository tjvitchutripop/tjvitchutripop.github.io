I begin my PhD in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.yale.edu">Yale University</a>, where I'll be working in the <a href='https://apollo-lab-yale.github.io'> Apollo Lab </a> led by <a href='https://dannyrakita.net'>Daniel Rakita<a>.  I'm excited to continue working on research in robot learning for manipulation!
